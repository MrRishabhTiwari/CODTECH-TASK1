# CODTECH-TASK1 Password Strength Checker

#### Objective
The objective of this project is to create a graphical user interface (GUI) application using Python and Tkinter that assesses the strength of a given password based on its composition of characters.

#### Key Activities
1. **Password Composition Analysis**: The application analyzes the password provided by the user to determine the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, whitespace characters, and special characters.
2. **Strength Assessment**: Based on the composition analysis, the application categorizes the password strength into five levels ranging from "Very Bad" to "Very Strong".
3. **User Interface Design**: Implemented a user-friendly interface using Tkinter with features including password entry, dynamic result display, strength indicator, and strength remarks.
4. **Password Visibility Toggle**: Included functionality to toggle password visibility between plain text and asterisks for user convenience.

#### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for application logic and tkinter for GUI development.
- **tkinter**: Python's standard GUI library used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **string module**: Python's built-in module used for character categorization (lowercase, uppercase, digits, etc.).

#### Key Insights
- **Password Strength Criteria**: The application evaluates password strength based on the presence of different types of characters. The more diverse the character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters), the stronger the password.
- **User Experience**: Providing real-time feedback on password strength and composition helps users create stronger passwords.
- **Security Awareness**: Encourages users to avoid weak passwords by highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse characters.
